//Instructions

//Write a class called Course that represents a course offered to students. 
//It should contain instance data that represents the course title (e.g. Computer Science), course code (e,g, AP CS A), pointsTotal, and course Instructorâ€™s name. 
//Define one Course constructor to accept and initialize all instance data. 
//Define a second constructor which accepts course name only.
//Include Accessor (getter) and Mutator (setter) methods for all instance data. 
//Include a toString method that returns a multi-line description of the course. 
//Create a driver class called CourseDetails whose main method instantiates and updates several Course objects (at least 3).
//At least one course should be created using the full object constructor, and one that uses the name only creator (but has the rest of it's values set by the setter and retrieved by getter methods).
//The main method should then print out each course from the toString.
